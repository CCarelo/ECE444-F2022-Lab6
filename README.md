Pros and Cons of Test-Driven Development

One advantage of TDD is increased modularity. Because TDD is an iterative cycle focusing on small tests, it forces code to be modularized. It's easier to simply make a function that takes in the input and returns matching output. Another pro of TDD is regression-testing, which is ensuring that old code performs as expected after making changes. In some cases, code changes can affect functions that were previously written and verified. TDD allows us to easily see whether any changes broke a previously passed test.

One disadvantage of TDD is good testing. No matter how many tests you write, if they aren't of quality, it's not useful. A test is only as good as the developer who wrote it. If the developer does not sufficiently understand the task at hand, TDD will not help. Another issue with TDD is the time investment. Developers need to spend time and effort to ensure they are writing good tests. For developers new to the concept, it can take even longer. Even simple implementations can take significantly longer to set up along with all the required tests.
